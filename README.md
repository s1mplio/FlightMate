# FlightMate

FlightMate now includes:

- A modular, versioned API (`/api/v1`) with health checks, search, pagination, and booking endpoints.
- Request context propagation (`x-request-id`), response-time headers, CORS, and rate limiting.
- A modern dashboard-style UI with search, metrics, and one-click booking.
- Node-native tests for key API paths.
